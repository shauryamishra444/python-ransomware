# python-ransomware
## this program is for educational purpose only and I won't be responsible for any damage caused by this program
this should be a ransomeware(I was supposed to attack my school and don't know why I made this shit(just kidding about my plan to attack my school))

this is how it looks like.
I am open for suggestions like always.(discord- shauryamishra)
## capable of... 
* creating persistence so that the victim can't escape the attack
* occupies the whole window (victim won't be able to quit the window)
* there is no way to access any other software
* once wrong password is entered the entry field will be invisible(you can alter the number of attempts to enter the password obviously)
* can display a certain message and image to the victim as shown above
* this won't encrypt any file, but maybe one day if I felt like actually attacking my school lab computers I'll add this function for sure(just kdding about the attack)
### and yes, I am open to new ideas and suggestions so feel free to share. (my discord id- shauryamishra)
